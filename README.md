        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Political Science with a minor in history. I work as Props Chief at Rodeheaver.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy making jewelry in my free time, especially on school breaks. i have participated in my local church, Faith Baptist Church, in Arizona for most                  of my life. I have taught sunday school, played piano, and done the slide shows for services. I love a good debate and enjoy learning new things that               expand my mind.
         </p> 
         <p>
            After I graduate Bob Jones, I plan to go to law school to further my education.
